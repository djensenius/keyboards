# Keyboards

The keymaps for my [Voyager](https://www.zsa.io/voyager) and [Pepito](https://clicketysplit.ca/blogs/news/in-loving-memory-of-annie-and-pepito) keyboards.

Voyager uses their software, which I believe is a QMK based keyboard.

Pepito uses ZMK, and the firmware is built and available in the latest [action](https://github.com/djensenius/keyboards/actions).

To flash the keyboard use the BOOTLDR command and plug the keyboard in.
